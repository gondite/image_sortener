# Image Organizer

This Python script organizes image files in a folder based on their creation or modification dates.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```
   
3. Copy and paste the following command to run the script:

    ```bash
    python image_organizer.py
    ```

This will organize the image files in the current directory into folders based on their creation or modification dates.

## Notes

This script assumes that the images are in the same directory where the script is located.
Images will be moved to folders named after the year and month of their creation or modification dates.
If any errors occur during the process, they will be displayed in the console.
